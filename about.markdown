Hey, I'm Jiri, a data and NLP engineer at [StockStory](https://stockstory.org/). 
I love learning about data and machine learning, travelling, staying fit, enjoying nature, and reading about anything and everything. 
I'll be sharing my thoughts on these topics regularly.

I'm always happy to receive feedback and discuss these topics, so please feel free to reach out to me via one of the contact methods listed at the bottom of this page
