## Introduction

I love reading. But sometimes, there's just so many other things to do that I can't seem to make time for it.
I'm not much into New Year's resolutions, but I thought setting a goal of reading a book per week would help me be more consistent.

Even though I fell 3 books short, I'm still happy with the result. I read a lot, learned a lot and enjoyed it a lot.
Some weeks, I read almost nothing, and periods when I read a couple books per week. Overall, my reading habits
were more stable than before.

In the following section, I'd like to highlight some of the books I enjoyed the most.

## Books I enjoyed the most

### An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us
- electric fish
- echolocation even in humans
- our perception of the world is so limited

### On Writing Well by William Zinsser
The advice in this book is straightforward, yet powerful. I'm trying to keep it in mind when writing any non-fiction.
Writing simply is hard. It is a craft tht needs to be practiced.
TODO:

### The Long Haul: A Trucker's Tales of Life on the Road
- immersing into a completely different world
### Ethics in the Real World: 90 Essays on Things That Matter
- interesting discussion of Singer's philosophy

## Conclusion
I knew that I was leaning towards non-fiction, but I didn't realize how much. I read 7 fiction books, and 42 non-fiction books.
I'll probably try to make this ratio more balanced in 2024. But it might be hard, because I've already stacked around 20 non-fiction books
that I'm excited about and I'm constantly getting new recommendations.

A book per week was a good goal. I'll try to hit it in 2024. Let's see how it goes this time.
