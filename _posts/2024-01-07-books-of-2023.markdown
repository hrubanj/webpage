## Introduction

I've long felt that I should make more time for reading.

Sometimes you don't feel like reading, but once you actually pick up a book, you realize how much you enjoy it.
Last year, I decided to try if setting a reading goal would help me be more consistent.

Even though I fell 3 books short (49 out of 52), I'm still happy with the result. I read more books than usual and I loved most of them.

Here, I'd like to highlight the ones I liked the most.

## My top books

### An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us by Ed Yong
Our perception of the world is primarily visual. But there are plenty other ways to sense our environment.
There are fish that can detect object based on electric resistance. Some birds can sense magnetic fields.
I used to think that echolocating animals can at best get a rough idea of the obstacles they need to avoid. And I was wrong. 
Some blind people echolocate so well that they can even ride a bike in traffic.

### On Writing Well by William Zinsser
Simple writing is hard. Rather than innate gift, it is a craft that you need to practice.
Writer should do the work of conveying the message, so, reader can understand it easily.
Writing that looks effortless often takes a lot of effort to produce. It takes a lot of rewriting.
As Einstein has said: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."
The book provides a ton of examples and practical advice.

### The Long Haul: A Trucker's Tales of Life on the Road by Finn Murphy
I'd never thought that trucker's memoirs could be so interesting. 
I expected a couple of funny anecdotes, but this book is much more. Murphy spent decades moving  rich people's stuff across US. 
He talks about the hierarchy of different trucker professions. 
He describes the relationships of truckers with trucking companies. 
And he also delves into the interaction with customers. He learns more about the people whose stuff he moves in a few days than their friends might learn in years. 
On top of that, the book is so damn readable.

### Ethics in the Real World: 90 Essays on Things That Matter by Peter Singer
Peter Singer is one of the most influential philosophers today. 
In the book, he writes about religion, abortion, war, charity and several other topics. 
He demonstrates that logical consistency can lead to very counter-intuitive moral conclusions. 
I enjoyed Singer's clear writing style and his intellectual honesty. 
But, I believe he doesn't justify some of his premises well enough. 
As a utilitarian, he thinks that minimizing suffering is the ultimate goal. 
That is problematic because it is unclear how to measure suffering. 
I realize that in the short space of an essay, he can't go into all the details. 
I'll need to read a bit more of his work to understand his position better.

## Conclusion
I'm happy to recommend more books to anyone who shows even the slightest interest. People who know me can attest to that.

A book per week was a good goal. Let's see how it works for 2024.
