goal: one book per week (52 books in total)
fell 3 books short
- most books recommended by several sources => I already assumed they would be good, so, they had to be
excellent to stand out
- individual books in 2-3 sentences, possibly images of the covers
- reaffirm the goal for 2024

## What I liked
### An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us
- electric fish
- echolocation even in humans
- our perception of the world is so limited
### On Writing Well
### The Long Haul: A Trucker's Tales of Life on the Road
- immersing into a completely different world
### Ethics in the Real World: 90 Essays on Things That Matter
- interesting discussion of Singer's philosophy
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVl5kMXz1vA
### Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art
### Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention
- admits that he has no magic pill
- some parts are not bringing too much new info
- technofixes likely won't work
