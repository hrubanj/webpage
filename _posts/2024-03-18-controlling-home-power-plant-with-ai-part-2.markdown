### Introduction
- previous scheduler did not work because it did not add enough value
- need to add optimization
- steps:
  - optimization (easy, linear solver)
  - accessing power plant production data (how much it produces)
  - weather data
  - predicting production - use some super-simple model
- putting it together - schedule jobs, store data, make rudimentary UI
- results and next steps


### Optimization
- a word on linear solvers
### Accessing power plant production data

### Weather data

### Predicting power plant production

### Integration and UI
