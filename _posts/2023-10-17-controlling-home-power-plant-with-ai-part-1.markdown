### Introduction
My parents installed solar panels on their house's roof. Besides consuming generated electricity, they can sell the excess to the grid.

You can save a lot of money if you optimize when to sell and when to store the electricity, because its prices fluctuate.

My brother and I thought it was a fun problem to solve. So, we decided to take a stab at it.

This is a first post in a series. Here, we'll make an overview of the problem. We'll also sketch the first iteration of the solution.
In following posts, we'll learn from its shortcomings, and improve upon it.

There is one caveat: We are not experts on power plants, or electricity trading.
We are learning a lot of the things as we are implementing them. So, it is quite likely
that we'll make some incorrect assumptions, and we'll have to go back and fix them. I'll try to be as transparent
as possible about this, and I'll try to correct the mistakes as soon as we find them. If you find any, please let me know.


### What are we trying to solve?
The solar panels generate electricity when sun is shining.

The following diagram shows how electricity can flow between the power plant, battery, grid, and consumption.

When the sun is shining, you can sell electricity to the grid, consume it, or charge the battery.
You can also charge the battery from the grid and consume either directly from the grid, or from the battery.
Some combinations of the above make sense, others less so.

### The big picture
The problem seems simple. You are just deciding whether to sell or store electricity.
But it may grow almost arbitrarily complex. You can keep refining weather predictions and their impact on solar panel output.
And you might also schedule consumptionâ€“for example, by running a dishwasher when the sun is shining.

If we want to build a functional solution quickly, we must not get bogged down in fancy micro-optimizations.

We'll create a working prototype, and then we'll improve it in iterations.
There's going to be lots of simplified assumptions, and some atrocious implementation shortcuts.

With the prototype in hand, we'll be able to verify our assumptions, and we'll know where to focus our efforts. Even the final solution might be
built on a lot of simplifications. After all, Newtonian physics is a simplification, and it works well most of the time.

Additionally, there won't be much AI in the first iteration. I'll explain why in the following sections.

### Variables under control

We can set the power plant to prefer charging the battery, selling to the grid, or just dumping electricity.
We can also set it to charge the battery from the grid.
Dumping excess solar electricity makes sense if the battery is full and sell price is negative.

The battery should be charged to between 10 % and 90 % of its capacity, otherwise
it will degrade faster. We'll take these thresholds as hard constraints.

### Spot prices
We sell electricity to the grid at spot prices, determined for hourly intervals by the market regulator ([OTE](https://www.ote-cr.cz/en/short-term-markets)).

The prices for the next day are published at 2 PM. This simplifies our problem, because we don't have
to predict them.

### Purchasing vs. selling prices
The buy price will usually be higher than the sell price.
It is possible to both buy and sell electricity at spot prices. In this case, the sell price
is still a bit lower because the grid operator charges a transmission fee for sold electricity.

Interestingly, spot prices can be negative. This means that you would have to pay for selling electricity.
It should also mean that we could get paid for consuming electricity.

### Default solution
The application provided by the power plant manufacturer has a default solution for controlling power plants.
You can, for example, set the maximum battery charge level. When it is reached, the power plant starts selling electricity to the grid.
When the battery is discharged below a certain level, the power plant starts charging the battery.
Own consumption is preferred over both charging and selling. This usually makes sense. Consuming produced electricity
is less lossy than selling it or storing it in the battery. And, as mentioned before, the buy price is usually higher than the sell price.

The default allows for some tuning, but it does not address one important issue:
It does not think ahead. It does not try to optimize when the selling should happen. And you might want to
sell the electricity at a price peak time even if the battery is not full.
With the default solution, you have to change settings manually, likely multiple times per day.

### Naive heuristic - start without AI
What is the easiest possible tool that can make this better?

I'd argue that a simple scheduler might be enough.

The two main requirements are that:
1. You should be able to configure what the power plant does at any given time (prefer charging, prefer selling, charge from grid), and
2. It should fall back to reasonable defaults if there is no specific configuration.

The first point ensures that you can set power plant behaviour for the 24 hours for which you know the spot prices, and
you don't have to reset it manually every time the behavior needs to change.

The second point lets you use heuristics based on historical data if you don't want or can't use granular configuration.

The scheduler's decision-making can then look something like this:

| Hour starting         	 | 7            	 | 8            	 | 9                 	 | 10           	 |
|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Global default        	 | CHARGING_SUN 	 | CHARGING_SUN 	 | CHARGING_SUN      	 | CHARGING_SUN 	 |
| Weekday settings      	 | SELLING_SUN  	 | -     	        | SELLING_SUN       	 | -    	         |
| Day-specific settings 	 | -     	        | -     	        | CHARGING_SUN_GRID 	 | -     	        |
| <b>Resulting mode</b> 	 | SELLING_SUN  	 | CHARGING_SUN 	 | CHARGING_SUN_GRID 	 | CHARGING_SUN 	 |

<span style="font-size:0.5em;">CHARGING_SUN sets the system to prefer charging over supplying, SELLING_SUN sets it to prefer supplying, CHARGING_SUN_GRID sets it to charge from both sun and grid. These are just example modes. You can come up with more possibilities.</span>

The scheduler always uses the most time-specific settings that it can find.
You set global default and weekday-specific settings based on patterns in historical data. You can then override these settings for specific days, e.g.
when the day is unusually sunny, or when electricity prices are unusually high.

We need to combine these modes with reasonable settings in the manufacturer's UI that will, for example, ensure that the
battery is not discharged below 10 %, no matter what mode the scheduler sets.


### Inferring default rules from historical data
Most patterns we see in historical data should not surprise us.
Intraday electricity prices react mostly to changes in demand (consumption). Supply is not able to adjust quickly enough to
accommodate different levels of demand during the day. I reckon it would be both difficult and expensive to have a power plant run
from 6 AM to 9 AM, and then shut it down for the rest of the day. It is probably cheaper to have it run all day.

Prices are higher in the morning and in the evening, and lower during the day. This is probably
because, in the morning, people are waking up, making breakfast, commuting etc. In the evening, people come home, cook dinner,
watch TV, and so on. During the day, most people are at work, so they consume less electricity.
This pattern does not hold on weekends, when many people are sleeping in, and / or not commuting as much.
The morning peak is significantly less pronounced on weekends, and the price is generally lower throughout the day.

*The prices in the images are standardized for year-month combinations (I subtract mean price for year-month for each value and divide by the standard deviation for that year-month).*
The peaks are not so prominent in winter, probably because of heating during the day. They are also shifted more towards
noon.

This shows us that we should expect high prices from 6 AM to 9 AM, and from 5 PM to 9 PM, except
for weekend mornings, and that we should calibrate our assumptions for winter and summer.


### Implementation
The solution must only read a configuration file and set the power plant mode.


We use a hierarchical configuration outlined above. Each entry in it has a start time, an end time, and a mode. Entries
can also have specific date, weekdays, or none of this. Date-specific entries take precedence over
weekday-specific entries, which take precedence over entries without any of these.

This lets you select exact mode based on expected price and consumption, but allows for defining
defaults that should function reasonably well if you don't want to configure the power plant too often.

We wrote a script that checks the configuration file and sets the mode.

A cronjob launches the script every hour. 

It runs on a cheap virtual server.

That's about it.

#### Communication protocol

The power plant manufacturer does not provide any public API for setting the power plant mode.
Hence, we had to reverse-engineer it from their UI.

On the positive side, we can use HTTP requests to call the manufacturer's server, and
we do not have to interact with the power plant directly via some exotic protocol. But that is probably
the only convenient part about it.

My brother had to become a bit of a cryptographer to figure out what the UI does. Just to give you an idea:
 - The API is not (publicly) documented.
 - You can't rely on status codes to tell you if a request was successful. It always returns 200 (success) status code. 
 - The response body is a list of numbers and some Chinese characters. Each number corresponds to a setting.
   - You have to figure out which number is which setting based on their order.
   - Translating the Chinese characters can give you a hint about what the response means.

And obviously, since the API is non-public, it can change anytime. Since I started writing this article, there was at least
one change that broke our script.

The reverse-engineering process is fascinating, and it would probably deserve its own article. I'll try to convince my brother to write one.

#### UI

Forcing users to upload configuration to a server might be too much of a stretch, so we use
a rudimentary Telegram-based API for this. 

We create a dedicated conversation for controlling the power plant. Users can upload configurations
to the conversation and tag a dedicated Telegram bot. The bot always reads the latest configuration and sets the mode.
If users want to deactivate the script, they can send a configuration message without any file.

The script logs the results of its run to the conversation. Users can, for example, see that the power plant
mode was either set, or the config was invalid.

### Results & lessons learned
It's been a while since I started writing this article. We had a chance to both implement the solution and watch it in action.
It was a bit of a disappointment.

It did exactly what we expected it to do.
The scheduler worked. It was switching power plant mode based on configuration. It logged the results to our Telegram chat.
So what was the problem?

Well, there were several:
1. In the initial solution, I failed to account for the fact that you can charge the battery 
from the grid. I didn't know that it was possible, and sometimes even necessary.
When no solar energy is generated for too long, the battery can get discharged below the 10 % threshold. So you need to charge it to prevent degradation.
This is easy to fix. Not a major issue. (I've already fixed this in the above text to avoid confusion.)

2. I didn't double-check that the intended user, i.e. my father, wants to use a scheduler and that it will be useful for him.
When I presented the idea, he seemed enthusiastic. But I failed to notice how he enjoyed fiddling with the
power plant settings. So, the scheduler was not saving him unpleasant work. It was rather robbing him of this hands-on experience.
This was a major issue.

3. Making non-programmers work with JSON configuration is a stupid idea. I wanted to use
the simplest possible configuration format. But JSON seems perfectly legible for people who are used to work with
mappings, arrays etc. A simple UI might have been a bit more work, but it would probably make the scheduler way more accessible.
I am not saying that this was an absolute showstopper. But it did require explaining. And the user experience was terrible.
Another major issue.

   
### Next steps
We'll have to pay more attention to user preferences. This seems obvious, but I guess
it is the type of lesson that you need to re-learn the hard way once in a while.

The solution can only be viable if it gives users something that they want. We know that saving labor
won't be enough. It has to make more profit than its users could generate on their own.

My original plan was to reap the benefits of automation first, and then start adding machine learning.
I've learned that we'll have to do it the other way round.

We've already started working on another iteration. Stay tuned for the next article!
